# APRS-IS-Lib

This Arduino library will provide an simple interface to the APRS-Tier2 server for ESP32 boards.
You can use the library for an APRS-iGate (like for LoRa, or other ideas).
Feel free to fork and upgrade the library!

### Supported platforms:
* __ESP32__ - tested with hardware on TTGO LORA32

If you have tested the code somewhere else please drop a ticket to track the status in this readme ;)
